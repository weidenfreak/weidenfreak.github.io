                  <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                  <p>I was born and raised close to Hamburg in Germany. After doing my bachelor's in computer science and media I worked as a software developer for five years.</p>
                  <p>I enjoy coding very much but I also became more and more interested in UX design. I therefore moved to Sweden to do my Master's in HCI.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I'm now on a journey to learn more about human-centred design. I aim to make useful products that empower people. Those products need to be well designed, on the technical side, but maybe even more importantly on the human side of things.</p>

                  <h3>Interests</h3>
                  <p>During the design process, I have found myself particularly engaged during the phases of user research, concept generation (sketches, wireframes, workshops), prototyping (with tools like Axure or directly in code) and user experience evaluations.</p>
                  <p>An area I am interested, but less confident in, is visual design.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, I have a strong interest in interactions beyond the Web as explored in my thesis (see "Works"). I also enjoy hardware prototyping with Arduino and/or wood quite a lot.</p>
