<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>This university project was developed in a team of two. Our task was to do an empirical study about participation in social media. We decided to focus on participation on the social coding platform <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. Our goal was to look at participation through a gender lens and find reasons why people participate or not participate.</p>
<p>A challenge hereby was that there are significantly less females than males in open source software development in general, and also on GitHub. Therefore we had to make sure to get a large dataset to be able to draw conclusions. We decided to use a questionnaire and data scraping to collect data.</p>
<h3>Data Scraping</h3>
<p>We used data scraping to test if there are differences in the amount of participation on GitHub, depending on gender. I wrote a script to collect user data from the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API</a> which represented the whole range of users depending on the registration date. GitHub users do not provide their gender so I identified their gender based on their name and location (if available) by using an API (<a href="http://genderize.io">genderize.io</a>).</p>
<p>Additionally, we needed data about the amount of participation. When looking at participation on GitHub, there are two different aspects to look at. One the one hand, there are code contributions, and on the other hand there are discussions. So, I wrote two other scripts to enrich our user database with the number of code contributions and the number of comments in discussions per user.*</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>Among the total sample size of 1195 GitHub users were 64% males, 7% female and 29% with unidentified gender.</p>
<p>As shown by the following graph, there are overall no large gaps concerning <strong>participation in code</strong>, depending on gender. However, the graph also shows that there are slightly more male power users.</p>

<p>In contrast to that, the following graph shows that there are significant differences when looking into <strong>participation in discussions</strong> on GitHub.</p>

</p>
<p>Overall, females seem to participate in discussions considerably less. Surprisingly, their contribution of code does not seem to be influenced by the fact that they are in the minority.</p>
<p>
<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
<p>Our questionnaire, which we designed together, had ten questions in total. The first three question asked about gender, registration date and if they reveal their real gender on their profile page. Afterwards we asked about their participation amount in discussions and code contributions. The last questions aimed to reveal the motives behind participation and non-participation.</p>
<h4>Results</h4>
<p>We collected a total number of 71 responses with our questionnaire. About 85% were male and 15% were female users.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the patterns about the differences in the amount of participation were the same as in our previous data collection. We also found that there are no differences when it comes to revealing gender on the profile page.</p>
<p>The following two graphs give some insights about why people participate. The first graph shows the reasons why people participate in discussions.</p>
</p>

</figure>
</p>
<p>From these answers we can see that females do initiate discussions but tend to avoid involving themselves in further conversations. The following graph shows why people don't participate in discussions.</p>

  <figcaption>Fig.4 - Why people don't participate</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>
<p>Based on these answers we can assume that females tend to avoid discussions on GitHub because they feel uncomfortable, are afraid of negative feedback or tend to question their competency. Males seem to be more self-confident about participating in discussions and less scared of negative feedback.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>The results obviously have to be interpreted with care because our questionnaire had only 11 female participants.</p>
</p>
<p><small>*  The data was extracted by using <a href="http://ghtorrent.org/">GHTorrent</a> and scraping the GitHub website because the GitHub API is not built to provide that kind of data in an efficient way.</small>
